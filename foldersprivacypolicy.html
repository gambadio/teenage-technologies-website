        <section id="privacy-policy">
            <p>Effective Date: December 29, 2023</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the ChatGPT Folders Chrome Extension ("Extension"), developed by Teenage Technologies. It explains how I handle user data in relation to the Extension. By using this Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Collection and Use</strong><br>The Extension does not collect, store, or process personal data of its users directly. User data may be accessed or used by the Extension only to the extent necessary for facilitating payments through ExtensionPay.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Processing</strong><br>For users who choose to access premium features, the Extension integrates with ExtensionPay, which in turn uses Stripe for processing payments. Any personal information required for processing payments, such as credit card details, is collected and handled by ExtensionPay and Stripe. I do not have access to, nor do I store, credit card information or other sensitive payment data.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Shared with Third Parties</strong><br>User data necessary for payment processing, such as name, email address, and payment details, are shared with ExtensionPay and subsequently with Stripe. I do not share personal data with any other third parties, except as required for payment processing or as required by law.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security</strong><br>I am committed to ensuring the security of user data but acknowledge that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong><br>I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time. Users will be notified of any significant changes through the Extension interface or other appropriate means.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Information</strong><br>For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at chatgptfolders@teenagetech.xyz.</li>
